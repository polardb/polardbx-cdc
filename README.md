## What is PolarDB-X CDC ?

PolarDB-X CDC is a core component of [PolarDB-X](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql) which is responsible for
global binary log generation, publication and subscription.

With PolarDB-X CDC, PolarDB-X database can provide binary log fully compatible with MySQL binary log, which can be
consumed seamlessly by MySQL binary log tools.
And it can play the role of MySQL slave through MySQL Replication protocol.

The core features of PolarDB-X CDC include the following:

* **Global Binlog**: Merges the original Binlog generated by all PolarDB-X DN nodes into a single global queue,
  providing a logical Binlog stream that ensures transaction integrity and orderliness, and can provide stronger data
  consistency guarantees.

* **Binlog-X**: Generates multiple logical Binlog streams in real-time to solve the bottleneck problem of Global
  Binlog in large-scale clusters, and provides stronger distributed scalability capabilities.

* **Replica**: Compatible with the MySQL Replication protocol, providing the ability to serve as a MySQL or PolarDB-X
  standby database.

## Quick Start

The PolarDB-X CDC is a builtin component of the PolarDB-X.

Try PolarDB-X CDC by following these steps:

1. Start a PolarDB-X

See [CDC Node Creation Guide](https://doc.polardbx.com/operator/ops/component/cdc/1-create-cdc-node-example.html) to
create a PolarDB-X instance with CDC nodes.

2. Try MySQL Binary Log Commands

PolarDB-X is fully compatible with MySQL binary log related commands, such as `SHOW BINARY LOGS`, `SHOW BINLOG EVENTS`,
etc. All commands can be found in
the [PolarDB-X Binlog Commands Introduction](docs/zh_CN/binlog-commands-intro.md).

3. PolarDB-X as MySQL Slave

PolarDB-X supports MySQL Replica related commands, such
as `CHANGE MASTER TO`，`START/STOP/RESET SLAVE`，`SHOW SLAVE STATUS`, etc. you can use PolarDB-X as MySQL slave, refer
to  [Replica Reference Manual](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-cdc/tree/main/polardbx-cdc-rpl/README.md) for command
details.

See [more docs](https://github.com/polardb/polardbx-sql#quick-start) about PolarDB-X.
